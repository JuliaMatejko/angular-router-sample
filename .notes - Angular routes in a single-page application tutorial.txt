--- Using Angular routes in a single-page application ---> https://angular.dev/guide/routing/router-tutorial

This tutorial describes how to build   a single-page application,   SPA that uses multiple Angular   routes  .

In a Single Page Application (SPA), all of your application's functions exist in a single HTML page.
As users access your application's features, the browser needs to render only the parts that matter to the user, instead of loading a new page.
This pattern can significantly improve your application's user experience.

To define how users navigate through your application, you use   routes  .
Add routes to define how users navigate from one part of your application to another.
You can also configure routes to guard against unexpected or unauthorized behavior.

--- Objectives
- Organize a sample application's features into modules.
- Define how to navigate to a component.
- Pass information to a component using a parameter.
- Structure routes by nesting several routes.
- Check whether users can access a route.
- Control whether the application can discard unsaved changes.
- Improve performance by pre-fetching route data and lazy loading feature modules.
- Require specific criteria to load components.

--- Create a sample application
Using the Angular CLI, create a new application, angular-router-sample. This application will have two components: crisis-list and heroes-list.

1. Create a new Angular project, angular-router-sample.

  ng new angular-router-sample

When prompted with Would you like to add Angular routing?, select N.
When prompted with Which stylesheet format would you like to use?, select CSS.
After a few moments, a new project,   angular-router-sample,   is ready.

2. From your terminal, navigate to the   angular-router-sample   directory.

Create a component,   crisis-list  .

  ng generate component crisis-list


In your code editor, locate the file,   crisis-list.component.html   and replace the placeholder content with the following HTML.

  <h3>CRISIS CENTER</h3>
  <p>Get your crisis here</p>

Create a second component,   heroes-list  .

  ng generate component heroes-list

In your code editor, locate the file,   heroes-list.component.html   and replace the placeholder content with the following HTML.

<h3>HEROES</h3>
<p>Get your heroes here</p>

In your code editor, open the file,   app.component.html   and replace its contents with the following HTML.

<h1>Angular Router Sample</h1>
...
<app-crisis-list></app-crisis-list>
<app-heroes-list></app-heroes-list>


AND add imports for new components in   app.component.ts:

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [RouterOutlet, CrisisListComponent, HeroesListComponent],   <-- !!!
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrl: './app.component.css'
})

--- Define your routes
In this section, you'll define two routes:

- The route   /crisis-center   opens the crisis-center component.
- The route   /heroes-list   opens the heroes-list component.

A route definition is   a JavaScript object  .
Each route typically has   two properties  .
The first property,   path,   is a string that specifies the   URL path   for the route.
The second property,   component,   is a string that specifies   what component   your application should display for that path.

1. From your code editor, create and open the app.routes.ts file.

2. Create and export a routes list for your application:

  import {Routes} from '@angular/router';

  export const routes = [];

3. Add two routes for your first two components:

  {path: 'crisis-list', component: CrisisListComponent},
  {path: 'heroes-list', component: HeroesListComponent},

This routes list is an array of JavaScript objects, with each object defining the properties of a route.


--- Import provideRouter from @angular/router ---

  Routing   lets you   display specific views   of your application   depending on the URL path  .

To add this functionality to your sample application, you need to update the   app.config.ts   file
to use the router providers function,   provideRouter.   You import this provider function from   @angular/router  .

1. From your code editor, open the   app.config.ts   file.

2. Add the following import statements:

  import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';
  import { routes } from './app.routes';

3. Update the providers in the   appConfig  :

  providers: [provideRouter(routes)]

For   NgModule   based applications, put the   provideRouter   in the   providers list   of the   AppModule,
 or whichever module is passed to   bootstrapModule   in the application.

 --- Update your component with   router-outlet   ---

At this point, you have defined two routes for your application.
However, your application still has both the   crisis-list   and   heroes-list   components hard-coded in your   app.component.html   template.
For your routes to work, you need to update your template to   dynamically load a component   based on the URL path.

To implement this functionality, you add the   router-outlet   directive to your template file.

1. From your code editor, open the   app.component.html   file.

2. Delete the following lines.

  <app-crisis-list></app-crisis-list>
  <app-heroes-list></app-heroes-list>

3. Add the   router-outlet   directive.

  <router-outlet></router-outlet>

4. Add   RouterOutlet   to the imports of the   AppComponent   in   app.component.ts

  imports: [RouterOutlet],


View your updated application in your browser. You should see only the application title.
To view the crisis-list component, add crisis-list to the end of the path in your browser's address bar. For example:

http://localhost:4200/crisis-list

Notice that the   crisis-list   component displays. Angular is using the route you defined to dynamically load the component.
You can load the   heroes-list   component the same way:

http://localhost:4200/heroes-list


--- Control navigation with UI elements ---

Currently, your application supports two routes. However, the only way to use those routes is for the user to manually type the path in the browser's address bar.
In this section, you'll add two links that users can click to navigate between the   heroes-list   and   crisis-list   components. You'll also add some CSS styles.
While these styles are not required, they make it easier to identify the link for the currently-displayed component. You'll add that functionality in the next section.

Open the   app.component.html   file and add the following HTML below the title.

<nav>
  <a class="button"
     routerLink="/crisis-list">
    Crisis Center
  </a> |
  <a class="button"
     routerLink="/heroes-list">
    Heroes
  </a>
</nav>

This HTML uses an Angular directive,   routerLink  . This directive   connects the routes   you defined to your template files.

Add the   RouterLink   directive to the imports list of AppComponent in app.component.ts.

Open the app.component.css file and add the following styles.

.button {
    box-shadow: inset 0 1px 0 0 #ffffff;
    background: #ffffff linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffffff 5%, #f6f6f6 100%);
    border-radius: 6px;
    border: 1px solid #dcdcdc;
    display: inline-block;
    cursor: pointer;
    color: #666666;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 15px;
    font-weight: bold;
    padding: 6px 24px;
    text-decoration: none;
    text-shadow: 0 1px 0 #ffffff;
    outline: 0;
}
.activebutton {
    box-shadow: inset 0 1px 0 0 #dcecfb;
    background: #bddbfa linear-gradient(to bottom, #bddbfa 5%, #80b5ea 100%);
    border: 1px solid #84bbf3;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-shadow: 0 1px 0 #528ecc;
}

If you view your application in the browser, you should see these two links. When you click on a link, the corresponding component appears.

--- Identify the active route ---

While users can navigate your application using the links you added in the previous section,
they don't have a straightforward way to identify what the active route is.

Add this functionality using Angular's   routerLinkActive   directive.

From your code editor, open the   app.component.html  file.
Update the anchor tags to include the   routerLinkActive   directive.

<nav>
  <a class="button"
     routerLink="/crisis-list"
     routerLinkActive="activebutton"
     ariaCurrentWhenActive="page">
    Crisis Center
  </a> |
  <a class="button"
     routerLink="/heroes-list"
     routerLinkActive="activebutton"
     ariaCurrentWhenActive="page">
    Heroes
  </a>
</nav>

Add the   RouterLinkActive   directive to the imports list of AppComponent in app.component.ts.

View your application again. As you click one of the buttons, the style for that button updates automatically,
identifying the active component to the user.
By adding the   routerLinkActive   directive, you inform your application to apply a specific CSS class to the active route.
In this tutorial, that CSS class is   activebutton,   but you could use any class that you want.

Note that we are also specifying a value for the   routerLinkActive's   ariaCurrentWhenActive.  
This makes sure that visually impaired users (which may not perceive the different styling being applied) can also identify the active button.
For more information see the Accessibility Best Practices Active links identification section.

--- Adding a redirect ---

In this step of the tutorial, you add a route that   redirects the user   to display the   /heroes-list   component.

1. From your code editor, open the   app.routes.ts   file.

2. Update the routes section as follows.

  {path: '', redirectTo: '/heroes-list', pathMatch: 'full'},

  Notice that this new route uses an   empty string   as its path. In addition, it replaces the component property with two new ones:

Properties	Details

redirectTo	This property instructs Angular to redirect from an empty path to the heroes-list path.

pathMatch	This property instructs Angular on how much of the URL to match. For this tutorial, you should set this property to   full  .
            This strategy is recommended when you have an empty string for a path. For more information about this property, see the Route API documentation.

Now when you open your application, it displays the   heroes-list   component by default.


---- Adding a 404 page ----

It is possible for a user to try to access a route that you have not defined.
To account for this behavior, the best practice is to display a 404 page.
In this section, you'll create a 404 page and update your route configuration to show that page for any unspecified routes.

From the terminal, create a new component, PageNotFound.

  ng generate component page-not-found

From your code editor, open the   page-not-found.component.html   file and replace its contents with the following HTML.

  <h2>Page Not Found</h2>
  <p>We couldn't find that page! Not even with x-ray vision.</p>

Open the   app.routes.ts   file and add the following route to the routes list:

  {path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent}

The new route uses a path,   **.   This path is how Angular identifies   a wildcard route  .
Any route that does not match an existing route in your configuration will use this route.

IMPORTANT: Notice that the wildcard route is placed at the end of the array.
The order of your routes is important, as Angular applies routes in order and uses the first match it finds.

Try navigating to a non-existing route on your application, such as http://localhost:4200/powers.
This route doesn't match anything defined in your   app.routes.ts   file.
However, because you defined a wildcard route, the application automatically displays your   PageNotFound   component.

--- Next steps
At this point, you have a basic application that uses   Angular's routing feature   to change what components the user can see based on the URL address.
You have extended these features to include   a redirect,   as well as   a wildcard route   to display a custom 404 page.
